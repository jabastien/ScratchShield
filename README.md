P.S. I'm using this (http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Tactile-Push-Button-Switch-Momentary-Tact-With-LED-12X12X7-0-4-pin-DIP-Through-Hole-Original/803738591.html) button with integrated LED. A normal tactile switch (6 x 6 mm) can be used also (place between row 3 and 5). A LED can be placed between row 1 and 3 (if necessary replace the 100 Ohm resistor with a 330 Ohm one). You don't need to change the sketch in this case.
